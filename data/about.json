            "Cosmic City was born out of some jam sessions with the Rythm section Mark and Will spark some groovy songs and then added on Kevin and Bennett to form Cosmic City",            
"Cosmic City is an original band based out of New York City all members writing new songs every week as we are inspired to bring new sounds to every jam session, the hardest part for the group is picking what songs to play at our gigs, always wanting to leave the best song for last is not the easiest decision",
             "Come see us live and you will hear the sounds of soul, jazz, funk and a little of everything else that inspires us."
