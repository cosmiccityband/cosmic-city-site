            "Cosmic City was born out of some jam sessions with between Will and Mark that called out to anyone we knew to come join in and enjoy some funky tunes",            
"Cosmic City is an original band based out of New York City all members writing new songs whenever we get together, throwing down ideas on phone recordings or tracking multiple lines. sending them around to the group so everyone can listen and work on it at rehearsal. Every rehearsal we are inspired to bring new sounds to the demos, the hardest part for the group is picking what songs to play at our gigs, always wanting to leave the best song for last is not the easiest decision",
             "Come see us live and you will hear the sounds of soul, jazz, funk and a little of everything else that inspires us."
